**Features / Highlights**
  **‚Ä¢ Business Problem**

The company manages diverse product categories and regions, but lacks a consolidated and easy-to-digest view of performance. Tracking YTD progress, identifying top-performing products, and spotting underperforming segments requires significant manual effort.

  **‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard**

  To deliver an intuitive sales intelligence tool that:
   * Monitors overall performance (sales, profit, quantity, and margins).
   * Identifies trends across categories, products, and regions.
   * Supports strategic decisions for pricing, marketing, and inventory planning.
   *  Provides segment-based (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) comparisons.
